A two layered CNN based model is created and the initial weights and biases of the model is stored in a path file. We aim to find the working of various optimizers on the MNIST dataset and analyze the effectiveness of the optimizers on the CNN model implemented.
We then train the model for six different optimizers using the saved model and initialised weights and compare the accuracies, run-time, epochs and the mean and standard deviation taken to find the optimal model to be used and the optimum number of epochs needed to train the model for best results.

*To compare the optimizers the learning rate is taken constant as 0.001
